This document is a place to jot down ideas that may not be fully fleshed out, or which have not been agreed to by the whole team.

(Once ideas are more complete and agreed upon, they should move into the DESIGNDOCUMENT file.)

# Races

* **Humans**: normal, boring.  Good at improving skills with practice.

* **Robots**: don't require life support, but also don't improve with practice.

* **Bugs**: think Starship Troopers or Ender's Game.  Come in different castes, each specialized for one job.  Make most other races very nervous, even within the same crew; forbidden on some worlds.  Most fun to play in a Bug ship, which is a living entity that can grow and produce new crewmen in its hatchery.

* **Betazoid**: empaths that are weak on combat but both sensitive and persuasive, giving them an advantage in negotiation.  (We'll probably need to think up a different name.)


# Commodities

* **Robots**: buy on high-tech worlds, sell on low-tech ones.  But illegal on some (Luddite) worlds.  Also, trading in these makes any robot crewmembers unhappy, and they may refuse to participate.


# Ship Equipment/Features

* **Secret Compartments**: there are (somewhat shady) places that can add small rooms to your ship behind a secret door which is ignored by boarders.  You can use these to smuggle goods or hide crewmembers.  However, such secret compartments reduce your ship's maximum hull points.
