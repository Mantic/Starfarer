## What is the game about? ##

Starfarer is a game about managing the crew of a merchant spaceship.

### The mundane vs. the wonderful ###
The environment the crew is in is exciting. In space there is opportunity to encounter something new at every corner, so encounters are wonderful, mysterious and new. Their daily life on the other hand is not. The crew needs to eat and sleep and has simple needs that need to be fulfilled.

### The crewmembers are people ###
Our crewmembers are individuals that have unique wants, needs and personalities. We focus on the life of a handful of people so that it is possible to form attachments to every single one of them.

### The crew is not it's members ###
Even tho we focus on stories of individuals the crew can grow and shrink. People can join an leave but the crew will still be the crew.

### Fail forward ###
Mishaps and failures should be interesting. The focus of problems is not the setback it causes but new problems and challenges that can be solved and overcome.
